This analysis makes use of the dplr package.  If you do not have the dplr package installed, use the following command to do so, before proceeding:

install.packages("dplyr")

The only script required to produce the two tidy sets of data is run_analysis.R.  To run the script you must first modify line 3 which is the directory on your system  where you would like to download and produce the two sets of tidy data.  The resulting tidy data sets are included in this repo so verification can be performed without actually running the script.
